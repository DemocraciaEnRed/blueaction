Blueaction was born in 1978 in Australia, a group of artists and biologist founded the organization to protect the seawaters of Queensland using a mix of science and art intervention, they called: Scienart.

Our organization has actions in three main areas:
* Protect the biodiversity of the oceans,
* Generate awareness and action through “scienart” and  
* Change corporate and government policies.

Blueaction has offices in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong and we have a 300.000 supporters and international foundations.  Our organization has an operational budget of U$ 45 million to develop our programs in the three countries.

We’ve opened 5 years ago our legacy program and we got this year the generous donations of one the supporters, _**Dorothy Mc Cormick**_ that donate by a will U$5 million to Blueaction.  She was an ocean lover and an activist for the democracy, in her honor in Blueaction want to test a new model to empower our supporters: **giving the chance to choose where allocates these special extra funds for our plan 2017-2020.**

**We ask you as “Innovation camper” of the IFC 2016 to test the beta version of our app.**

**You will have the chance to vote for three different environmental projects. You will decide for the future of this fund!  You need to select one project and reject the other two ones.**
